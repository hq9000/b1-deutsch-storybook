# B1 deutsch storybook, written by an AI, curated by a human

This is a book of AI-generated stories covering German vocabulary on B1 level. Its purpose is to help learners memorize the words by providing them in context, repeating them multiple time and providing accessible translations into English and Russian. Readers are suggested to spend around 20 minutes on one story.

The book was written while preparing for my B1/B2 exams in Goethe Institute in 2023. It is based on vocabulary required for B1 and was primarily made with ChatGPT-3.5.

The book is composed of 95 stories each highlighting a group of about 30 randomly chosen words. Each story is accompanied with a vocabulary table with translations and short examples. Translations include English and Russian ones.

The official homepage of this book is: [https://github.com/hq9000/b1-deutsch-storybook](https://github.com/hq9000/b1-deutsch-storybook)
