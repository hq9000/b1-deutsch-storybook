I want you to create a completely different story, in German, that will use all the words. It is absolutely essential that each and every word from the list above is used.

The story must have a title. The words from the list should be bold.

It is important that every word from the list above is used.

Do not use word "Abenteuer". Mark the words from the list bold when they are used in the text.

===============================================

Now summarize this text in 2-3 sentences in German.

===============================================

write the same text, but as a table, rows corresponds to paragraphs, title occupies the first row. 
the first column of this table must be this german text, 
the second - its corresponding english translation,
the third - russian translation

do not cut paragraphs short, translate full paragraphs

Use markdown format for the table.

===============================================

create a table containing the following columns:

1. the word
2. english translation
3. russian translation
4. example sentence in german, preferably taken from the text or something similar.

use all the words, don't cut it short even if the output is big. The table should be sorted alphabetically based on german words not considering articles (do not omit the articles in the table though, omit them only for sorting purposes).

in the first column, if the word is a noun, add a definite article.

create this table as you usually do, in markdown
