I will give you a list of german words. I want you to create a story that will help me to memorize them. It should have a title.

It is important that every word is used.
I want you to mark the words from the list bold.

the story should be composed as three jokes told by a hairdresser:
the first one should be about circus
the second - about tram
and the thirt aboud a present (Geschenk)

the list of words follows:


Vollzeit

Frisur

fortsetzen
heutig-
leiten
Verlag
früh
zumachen
parken
einrichten

===============================================

create a table containing the following columns:

1. the word
2. english translation
3. russian translation
4. example sentence in german, preferably taken from the text or something similar.

use all the words, don't cut it short even if the output is big. The table should be sorted alphabetically based on german words not considering articles (do not omit the articles in the table though, omit them only for sorting purposes).

in the first column, if the word is a noun, add a definite article.

create this table as you usually do, in markdown
